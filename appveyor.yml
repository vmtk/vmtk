# Notes:
#   - Indent each level of configuration with 2 spaces. Do not use tabs!
#   - All section names are case-sensitive.
#   - Section names should be unique on each level.
#   - Add [skip ci] or [ci skip] to commit message title and build wonâ€™t be triggered by AppVeyor 
#     for that commit. Or explicitly skip AppVeyor only with [skip appveyor] and still allow any
#     other CI to build the commit (eg. Travis CI).

# to the "test_script", appveyor unknowningly builds the package all while watching for
# the results of the tests to run.
