# The language in this case has no bearing - we are going to be making use of "conda" for a

# build matrix of environments to build against. 
# note: for linux builds, sudo is required. This is not because we use any "sudo" commands
#       instead, we use it to build a non-container image with TravisCI, which has more memory
#       than a container image (if sudo was set to false). This is required because the build phase
#       utilizes more memory than the container image has, causing a segfault.
